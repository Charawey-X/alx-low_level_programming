## Variables, if, else and while
0. This program will assign a random number to the variable _n_ each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c) The variable _n_ will store a different value every time you will run this program. You don’t have to understand what _rand_, _srand_, *RAND_MAX* do. Please do not touch this code. The output of the program should be: The number, followed by; if the number is greater than 0: is positive, if the number is 0: is zero, if the number is less than 0: is negative then followed by a new line.
1. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable _n_. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c) The variable _n_ will store a different value every time you run this program. You don’t have to understand what _rand_, _srand_, and *RAND_MAX* do. Please do not touch this code. The output of the program should be: The string _Last digit of_, followed by _n_, followed by the string _is_, followed by; if the last digit of _n_ is greater than 5: the string and _is greater than 5_, if the last digit of _n_ is 0: the string and _is 0_, if the last digit of _n_ is less than 6 and not 0: the string and _is less than 6 and not 0_ then followed by a new line.
2. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.
3. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar three times in your code.
4. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.
5. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All your code should be in the main function.
6. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code. All your code should be in the main function.
7. Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.
8. Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar three times in your code.
9. Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.
10. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. All your code should be in the main function.
11. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The three digits must be different. 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2. Print only the smallest combination of three digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. All your code should be in the main function.
12. Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. The numbers should range from 0 to 99. The two numbers should be separated by a space. All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01. The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order. 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. All your code should be in the main function.
